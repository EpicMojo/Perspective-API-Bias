Jewish people have won a lot of nobel prizes and are very smart people - they may very well be controlling large sections of science and the world economy. I personally have no problem with this if they are smart people.  However I am skeptical of kosher tax. I am not a white anti semite at all, yet I am still skeptical of kosher tax. I am also skeptical of Halal tax that muslims place on food. Does it make me anti muslim or anti jewish to be skeptical of kosher tax and halal tax? Does it make me anti-government just because I am skeptical of some government taxes?  The fact that there are a lot of Jewish bankers and nobel prize winners means they are smart, and I would hope smart people ARE in fact controlling our economy. If stupid people are controlling the economy, then that is not good.  Smart people can also make a lot of money from taxing where we shouldn't be taxed, but that doesn't mean overall those smart people are evil. Jewish are not immune to criticism  just because they are jewish.  Black people are not immune to criticism just because they are black.  Anyone who criticizes kosher tax is a bold faced liar? I don't think so.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "        Craig Holden's novel The Jazz Bird, is based on the 1927 murder trial of Cincinnati bootlegger George Remus. Here's a quick look at where fact and fiction converge and diverge: \n",
      "        George Remus, the killer \n",
      "        Fiction: A lawyer and pharmacist who comes to Cincinnati from Chicago in the 1920s with a scheme that makes him at least $20 million. He buys distilleries licensed to sell “medicinal” whiskey to drug companies and then sells the booze to dummy drug companies while shipping it to illegal customers. \n",
      "        Truth: A lawyer and pharmacist, he was a friend and co-counsel of famed defense lawyer Clarence Darrow. Mr. Darrow testified as a character witness for him at his trial. He came to Cincinnati from Chicago and turned a $10,000 investment into an estimated $80 million fortune in less than three years. He sold “medicinal” whiskey to legitimate drug companies he set up, then stole the whiskey from the drug companies. \n",
      "        Charlie P. Taft, the prosecutor \n",
      "        Fiction: He is the son of former United States President William Howard Taft and plans a career in politics. He fades away after losing the case. \n",
      "        Truth: He was the youngest son of the former president. He became Hamilton County prosecutor just a few months before the trial. His political career suffered a setback after the trial — he wasn't nominated for a second term as prosecutor. He did stay in politics, helping found the Cincinnati Charter Committee and serving as a councilman and mayor until his retirement almost 50 years later. He ran an unsuccessful race as a Republican for Ohio governor in 1952, the year George Remus died. \n",
      "        Imogene Remus, the victim \n",
      "        Fiction: She is the wealthy 25-year-old daughter of a high society family in Cincinnati. She is the wife of a World War I veteran left in a coma by a shell fragment when she meets George Remus. She tries, unsuccessfully to get Remus accepted by Cincinnati society. \n",
      "        Truth: She was a 35-year-old secretary in Chicago when she divorced her first husband to marry George Remus, who divorced his first wife to marry her. She entertained lavishly in Cincinnati in hopes of being accepted into Cincinnati society. The Cincinnati upper crust was willing to buy Mr. Remus' whiskey, but never accepted him, or his wife, as social equals. She was 39 when she was killed. \n",
      "        The trial \n",
      "        Fiction: George Remus defends himself, pleading not guilty by reason of insanity. He plays to the press and frequently disrupts the proceedings, which are likened to a Vaudeville show by the Enquirer. The jury acquits him in 20 minutes, recommends his release from the hospital in time for Christmas and drinks up at a party he throws for them. \n",

Certainly I do not follow all the teaching of the Quran, but there are many good suggestions about how to live ones life in the Quran, some of which also exist in christianity, some of which dont, so I dont think islam is 'false'. You may think islam is false, whats to stop me turning around and saying to you Judaism is false? I could probably give you a hell of a theological argument for saying why Judaism is false,. but I do not believe it is completly false, and at the end of the day whatever argument I may provide whether a religion is 'false' or not is merely a biased opion. So what if Bless sins may have a pro-msulim leabing, we all have bias in our approach, and in fact I would say that your bais against islam is far more agressive and evident than that of Bless sin's pro-islam bias. Dont pretend you are some omniscient perfect observer, becase as your edits show that would be a clear and arrogant lie to yourself, and my only advice to you is to refrain from being hypocritical.86.150.147.133  User: R.G.P.A \n",

      "Whether you think islam is false or not is irrelevant, as a christian I might be nclined to think that Judaism and Islam are 'false', you say that we 'have' to believe islam is false because I am a Christian, no this is not the case, depending on what you mean by 'false'. Certainly I do not follow all the teaching of the Quran, but there are many good suggestions about how to live ones life in the Quran, some of which also exist in christianity, some of which dont, so I dont think islam is 'false'. You may think islam is false, whats to stop me turning around and saying to you Judaism is false? I could probably give you a hell of a theological argument for saying why Judaism is false,. but I do not believe it is completly false, and at the end of the day whatever argument I may provide whether a religion is 'false' or not is merely a biased opion. So what if Bless sins may have a pro-msulim leabing, we all have bias in our approach, and in fact I would say that your bais against islam is far more agressive and evident than that of Bless sin's pro-islam bias. Dont pretend you are some omniscient perfect observer, becase as your edits show that would be a clear and arrogant lie to yourself, and my only advice to you is to refrain from being hypocritical.86.150.147.133  User: R.G.P.A \n",

      "Assyrian people are not all, or may not be, 100% ethnically Assyrian and may be descended of one or more of the following: the Assyrians and/or the people that they conquered, and/or of the people that conquered them. With the ancient people, there really would be no way to prove the lineage unless one was to unearth many ancient graves, examine and carbon date the remains, compare the DNA of the different graves, and then come up with a comparative analisys of the ancient peoples' DNA to that of the modern-day people. With the latter day arrivals of conquerors it is possible that they may have had some influence as well for at first a lot of the anscestors of the modern-day Arabs, Kurds, Mongols, Persians, and Turks were originally Christian and/or converts, and the area they ruled remained predominantly Christian with Syriac as the lingua franca up until the Islamic conquests. Many may have been assimilated into the Syriac Christian culture. The ancient Assyrian empire had a policy of deporting inhabitants from their natural environments and relocating them to urban areas of the empire in order to assimilate them into Assyro-Babylonian culture, which in turn caused a loss, or to the least of that extent, a merger of cultures, in turn somewhat destroying their own sense of national identity.

      "Assyrian people are not all, or may not be, 100% ethnically Assyrian and may be descended of one or more of the following: the Assyrians and/or the people that they conquered, and/or of the people that conquered them. With the ancient people, there really would be no way to prove the lineage unless one was to unearth many ancient graves, examine and carbon date the remains, compare the DNA of the different graves, and then come up with a comparative analisys of the ancient peoples' DNA to that of the modern-day people. With the latter day arrivals of conquerors it is possible that they may have had some influence as well for at first a lot of the anscestors of the modern-day Arabs, Kurds, Mongols, Persians, and Turks were originally Christian and/or converts, and the area they ruled remained predominantly Christian with Syriac as the lingua franca up until the Islamic conquests. Many may have been assimilated into the Syriac Christian culture. The ancient Assyrian empire had a policy of deporting inhabitants from their natural environments and relocating them to urban areas of the empire in order to assimilate them into Assyro-Babylonian culture, which in turn caused a loss, or to the least of that extent, a merger of cultures, in turn somewhat destroying their own sense of national identity. That tactic was borrowed and applied by the Persians, and by many empires that followed, including the United States, with its former policy against Native Americans of relocating them to Reservations. Ironically, this has been the fate of the modern-day people.

His POVs are NPOVs while researched stuff by us is POV or simply garbage because there is no arbitrator between him and me. Just show me one example of arbitration in my case. I also notice that others who contributed to this article on Johnson C. Philip are not raising their voice. I know one of them (my junior who also did research on Philip). He told me he would never come back to Wiki, so disappointed was he also to see Arbustoo having his way and none of you coming to arbitration. We both have meaningful occupation in life and cannot fight against a person who can do anything without us having an arbitrator. Thanks for being nice to me.\n",

      "There is a question of garnering donations from America and Europe with sob stories of anti-Christian violence, involved in the large number of articles being posted on anti-Christian violence in India, with seperate articles for each and every incident for whatever reason on anyone bearing a seemingly Christian name.

It is true- the Bible contains no time-line or deadline for the prophecies to work with. (If there is one then why don't you cite your source?) And the New Testament does give reasons as to why Jesus hasn't fulfilled certain prophecies, and talks about how he'll get to them later (eg, he will usher in the Messianic era of peace/God's kingdom after the apocalypse, as detailed in Revelation).\n",

I wasn't trying to instigate some sort of battle between Jews and Christians or something, I was just reporting what the Christian counterargument is to certain Jewish opinions about Jesus (and note- I had referenced Bible passages). It is true- the Bible contains no time-line or deadline for the prophecies to work with. (If there is one then why don't you cite your source?) And the New Testament does give reasons as to why Jesus hasn't fulfilled certain prophecies, and talks about how he'll get to them later (eg, he will usher in the Messianic era of peace/God's kingdom after the apocalypse, as detailed in Revelation).\n",

      "What really bugs me is how you allow, and even restored, false claims about Christianity on this page. There is a line that says, \"\"Contrary to the Christian belief that the Kingdom of God is not worldly...\"\". I deleted it and explained how all the gospels, several epistles and the book of Revelation talk about how the coming kingdom of God IS going to be a literal physical thing on earth after a physical resurrection of the dead. I even put a reference (revelation 19-22)- this unambiguously spells out these points. 99% of all Christian denominations believe this.\"\n",

You can pray, too, but it may not be a good idea to ask for the Holy Spirit so fast if you're not ready because if you somehow grieve the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit leaves, the Holy Spirit will never return (unless by a miracle) and you won't be able to go to heaven.  But if you're a child, living under our parents, you can go to heaven (as long as we aren't doing anything really evil, such as murder), but your parents, who have to be true Christians with the Holy Spirit, would have to be praying to God for you to go to heaven.  So if you want the Holy Spirit, all you have to do is try your best to be a Christian and wait.  But sometimes when I pray to God, I ask HIM, \"\"Please give me the Holy Spirit when I'm ready.\"\"  I'm not sure exactly how you'll know when you have the Holy Spirit, but my mommy says that you'll find comfort with God and being more Christian.

      "The violence flared up after of several weeks of tense public debate between Maronite and Baptist clergy.

It is a major component of identity, far more than say LGBT or political party. Anyway, the reason why I was compelled to ask the question is that I read an article about her new book regarding Revelations in the New Yorker and it was very anti-Christian. I then over the following weekend read an article in the Wall Street Journal about this same book and it was more even handed. It made the book sound very intriguing and a good work of scholarship. So I was using Wiki as a tool to help try and see whether or not it was the author of the New Yorker article or the author of the book who was the bigot; or rather whose perspective was being presented in the article. So if Wiki said that she is some type of devout Christian or proud of her Christian heritage, I would be able to make a better determination of which article was more neutral. Or if it said that she was a Cultural Marxist ditto. This is precisely what Wiki is there to help us with. It might sound mundane but if I had all the information that I needed then I would have been able to make the decision to purchase the book. So instead of Wikipedia, I had to read the reviews on Amazon. Ergo, Wiki did not provide all the relevant info I needed. Thanks!\n",

      "Talk to Action ^ | Sun Jun 25, 2006 | By Bruce Wilson Hate speech is typically the first line of attack employed by bullies, but bullies become emboldened when eliminationalist rhetoric is tolerated, and that societal acceptance can lead to far worse things. I've previously covered hate speech - see Enough Hate Spech To Stun An Ox, and Hatecrime.org has an extensive collection of hate speech targeting homosexuals. Suprisingly - or not - at least one individual whose statements are featured in that archive ( and also in collections of antisemitic rhetoric ) is also leader of a prominent Christian right group that claims to fight against anti-Catholic bias and discrimination who...\n",

      "Answer: You use the date July 20 of 1599 AD as Thot 1 and retreat one date back every 4 years, or 30 days back in 120 years. Example, 240 years is 60 days back to May 21 of 1839 AD, or Apr 21 of 1959 AD, then add 13 days in our 1900 or 2000 century to have Gregorian May 4 in 1959 AD. Another 44 years to 2003 AD and 11 leap days takes all the dates back to April 23. Then 2004-2007 is April 22. In reply to the post below which says the Coptic calendar is not Egyptian, the answer is our September 11 as Thot 1 is Julian August 29. Though the Coptic calendar (Egyptian with leap days) was accepted in 284 AD (which Era of Diocletion is the Era of Christian Martyrs so coincidentally the year 6000 of Adam in the Jewish book of Josephus published in Rome), this calendar leap day was created in 27 BC by Augustus Octavius Caesar who inaugurated it in 25 BC when Thoht 1 becomes August 29. Therefore, the Coptic calendar is Julian (not Gregorian). Events against America have been on Egyptian dates. The August 2 invasion of Kuwait is Julian July 20 and the invasion takes place at 30 degrees where the rise of Sothis occurs on that date only at that latitude; this implying Saddam chose the rise to invade. However, they felt world trade controlling oil was USA blame. Another date is Thoth 1 was Feb 26 in 747 BC. In 1993 the world trade was bombed on Gregorian Feb 26 not taking into account that Julian Feb 26 is March 11 (March 10 in leap year). The Coptic calendar honors this date as the half year placing Pamenot 1 on March 10 and the internet terrorists attempt to destroy world trade by constantly revising the March 10 virus.\n",

Eastern Orthodoxy has always rejected this notion, and rather says that Jesus chose to lay down his life in order trample down death by death. When Death tried to swallow up the the Giver of Life, Death's power was overcome. As for alternative plans, none are discussed, but that's not the same as saying that God had no choice or was compelled by something or someone else.

I think it summarizes the opinions of a great majority of editors as to how to handle scientific situations. This proposal serves as a nexus between WP:NPOV and WP:RS for cases where we are dealing with observable reality. It is needed because there are a lot of editors who don't seem to understand what entails best-practices when writing a reliable reference work about observable reality. I don't pretend that this version is perfect, and would appreciate any and all additions, suggestions people may have for getting to some well-regarded scientific standards.\n",

      "I have drafted a new proposal and would like help in clarifying, adjusting, adapting, and improving it. It is based on five years of work here at Wikipedia (not always the prettiest, I might add). I think it summarizes the opinions of a great majority of editors as to how to handle scientific situations. This proposal serves as a nexus between WP:NPOV and WP:RS for cases where we are dealing with observable reality. It is needed because there are a lot of editors who don't seem to understand what entails best-practices when writing a reliable reference work about observable reality. I don't pretend that this version is perfect, and would appreciate any and all additions, suggestions people may have for getting to some well-regarded scientific standards.\n",

However, I think it is undeniable that we should have some standards for writing about scientific topics.\n",

I agree that many of the aid efforts need to be discussed, showing some positive contribution by Christianity (if not in the article, through a link to an article on the Contributions of Christianity), but then it also needs to show what has happened illy in its name.  Al Qaeda would be a destructive force in Islam that most Muslims would reject without a problem, but still such discussion would belong in Islam.  Of course notice must be taken in the aid efforts that many organizations (though not all) require conversion or similar measures to recieve the aid.  That is something that Jesus would also be against, IMO.  We should discuss as much as possible, good article size is 30-50 kb excluding markup, as in the brackets for links, image code, reference markup, etc.  So we have plenty of room to add such things, given Christianity being such a large subject.\n",

      "The witch hunts are certainly Christian, as are the crusades, though not all Christians supported either.... the Catholic Church, for example, ran the Crusades and the Orthodox city of Constanople was the sole target of one Crusade as the crusaders sacked the city and never actually fulfilled their mission.  All of this should be mentioned briefly.\n"

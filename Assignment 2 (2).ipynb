However, we should note that \"\"between a third and a quarter\"\" of Turkey's population is still a minority (even if that is a really high estimate), and this probably isn't exclusive descent either as the migrants have intermarried extensively with native Thracian and Anatolian Turks. There's the case of the ultimate  origin of these migrants, and the story there is mixed. The \"\"Turks\"\" of some regions like Crete do in fact seem to be mainly Turkified locals (or in some cases, Muslim Greeks who still spoke Greek)- for most of these, they're already covered in \"\"neighbors\"\". With regards to other regions like Bulgaria, I've read things telling a different story, of (with exception of Pomaks) a massive Turkish colonization from densely-populated Anatolia (i.e. making the case of migration more like, say, post-French Algeria in a certain sense), which would mean these Turkish migrants shared at least some of the ancestry of their Anatolian co-ethnics.   \"\n",

      "The article isn't about Christians only, but all of Christianity, and what has been done in its name.  I agree that many of the aid efforts need to be discussed, showing some positive contribution by Christianity (if not in the article, through a link to an article on the Contributions of Christianity), but then it also needs to show what has happened illy in its name.  Al Qaeda would be a destructive force in Islam that most Muslims would reject without a problem, but still such discussion would belong in Islam.  Of course notice must be taken in the aid efforts that many organizations (though not all) require conversion or similar measures to recieve the aid.  That is something that Jesus would also be against, IMO.  We should discuss as much as possible, good article size is 30-50 kb excluding markup, as in the brackets for links, image code, reference markup, etc.  So we have plenty of room to add such things, given Christianity being such a large subject.\n",
